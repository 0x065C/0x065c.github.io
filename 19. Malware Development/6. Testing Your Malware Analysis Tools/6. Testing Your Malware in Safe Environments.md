# Virtual Machines (VMs)

Virtual Machines are the cornerstone of any safe malware testing environment. They allow you to isolate your malware from your primary operating system while providing you with the flexibility to reset or revert any damage easily.

#### Recommended VM Software
- VMware Workstation/Player: Known for robust performance and advanced features, including network configuration options.
- VirtualBox: Free and open-source, it supports most operating systems but has fewer features than VMware.
- Hyper-V: A native option in Windows (available in Pro and Server editions) that provides reliable performance.

#### Setting up a Virtual Machine for Malware Testing
1. Install the VM software (VMware, VirtualBox, or Hyper-V) on your host machine.
2. Create a Windows Virtual Machine:
   - Choose a Windows OS, preferably versions that are still common targets, such as Windows 10 or 11.
   - If you need older environments, you could use Windows 7 or even XP (with caution, as they’re no longer supported).
3. Networking Configuration:
   - Host-only network: Disables internet connectivity on the VM but allows communication between VMs. This is critical to ensure your malware does not spread beyond the VM.
   - NAT network: Allows the VM to access the internet while using the host's IP, but this should be used cautiously.
   - Isolate network access by ensuring the VM cannot communicate with your host machine. Disable shared clipboard, drag-and-drop, and folder sharing between host and VM.

#### VM Management Techniques
- Snapshots: Always take a snapshot of the clean state of your VM before running any malware. This allows you to revert to a known good state after testing. VMware and VirtualBox both have built-in snapshot functionality.
- Reverting Changes: After running the malware, if the system becomes unstable or infected, restore the VM to the snapshot you saved earlier.

#### Monitoring VMs
- External Tools: Use external monitoring tools to analyze how malware behaves in the VM. For example:
  - Wireshark for network traffic analysis.
  - Procmon (Process Monitor) to track file system changes, registry modifications, and process creation.
  - Process Hacker for detailed process inspection.

# Windows Sandbox

Windows Sandbox is a built-in feature in Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise, as well as Windows 11, providing a lightweight and isolated environment for running untrusted software. It's ideal for quickly testing smaller, simpler malware samples.

#### Benefits of Windows Sandbox
- Automatic Reset: Every time you run Windows Sandbox, you get a clean, isolated instance of Windows. All changes are discarded when you close the sandbox.
- Easy to Set Up: There's no need to configure anything. Simply enable Windows Sandbox from the Windows Features panel, and launch it like any other application.

#### Use Cases
- Quick Testing: If you're working on a small malware payload or trying to test specific functionality (like persistence mechanisms), Sandbox allows you to test rapidly without needing a full VM reset.
- System Calls: You can quickly observe how malware interacts with system APIs without modifying your main machine.

# Cuckoo Sandbox for Automated Malware Analysis

Cuckoo Sandbox is an open-source, highly customizable tool designed for automated malware analysis. It is capable of executing malicious files and analyzing their behavior in a virtual environment, making it a favorite for malware researchers.

#### Key Features
- Multi-VM Support: Cuckoo can be configured to run tests across multiple VMs with different OS versions (Windows, Linux, etc.), giving you a broader view of how malware behaves on different platforms.
- Automated Analysis: Cuckoo can generate detailed reports on process execution, network activity, filesystem changes, API calls, and more.
- Network Simulation: It can simulate a network environment (including the ability to route traffic through a proxy for further analysis) to observe C2 (command-and-control) interactions.

#### Setting up Cuckoo
1. Install Cuckoo on the host (typically Linux, but Windows support is available).
2. Create VMs in VirtualBox or VMware to serve as the analysis machines.
3. Configure Networking to allow for communication between the malware and the external network (if desired).
4. Run Malware: Cuckoo can automatically execute the malware sample on the VM and capture behavior such as network communication, file system modifications, API calls, and memory changes.

#### Benefits of Cuckoo
- Detailed Reports: Cuckoo provides an in-depth analysis of the malware’s activities, including how it interacts with system APIs and files.
- Customizable: You can configure the behavior of Cuckoo to fit your needs, including enabling/disabling certain features or plugins.
- Malware Automation: It reduces the manual effort required to analyze malware, particularly if you need to analyze many different samples quickly.

# Isolated Networks

To safely test malware that relies on network communication (e.g., command-and-control or lateral movement), you need to create an isolated network environment.

#### Configuring an Isolated Network
- Host-Only Networking: Configure VMs to use host-only networking to ensure they can communicate with each other but not with the internet or your host machine.
- Dedicated Router/Firewall: You can create an isolated physical network using an old router or network equipment to simulate an enterprise network without exposing your real network to infection.
- Firewall Rules: On the host or VM, configure strict firewall rules to limit outbound connections to specific IPs or block internet access entirely. This allows you to capture network-based behavior while keeping the test environment safe.

# Common Analysis Tools for VMs and Sandboxes

Once you’ve set up your virtual testing environment, the following tools will help monitor and analyze the malware's behavior:

#### Process Monitor (ProcMon)
- What It Does: ProcMon monitors system calls related to file system activity, registry changes, network access, and process creation.
- Use Case: Track the modifications that malware makes to the system, such as registry keys created for persistence or files written to disk.

#### Process Explorer
- What It Does: Similar to Task Manager but more detailed, Process Explorer gives you information on the running processes, DLLs loaded into memory, and handle usage.
- Use Case: Identify injected processes or unusual activity, such as hidden malware threads in a trusted process like `explorer.exe`.

#### Wireshark
- What It Does: Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer that captures network traffic in real-time, enabling you to see packet-level details of communication.
- Use Case: Analyze outbound traffic from the VM to see if the malware is communicating with external servers, exfiltrating data, or participating in C2 activities.

#### x64dbg/OllyDbg
- What It Does: These are debuggers that allow you to reverse engineer and step through the execution of your malware.
- Use Case: Inspect the runtime behavior of your malware in detail, identify anti-debugging techniques, or explore memory modifications.

# Advanced Isolation Techniques

#### Air-Gapped Networks
In some cases, it may be necessary to test malware in an air-gapped network, a system that has no physical or logical connection to the internet. This ensures complete isolation from the outside world.

- How to Set It Up: Simply disconnect the VM or isolated network from any internet or external network access.
- Use Case: If you're testing ransomware, worms, or malware that has highly destructive behavior, you may want to contain it entirely within a closed environment.

#### Honeypots
- What They Are: Honeypots are decoy systems designed to attract and analyze malware. 
- Use Case: They are particularly useful for understanding how malware operates in the wild, especially for malware that propagates via networks.

# Final Tips
- Monitor Everything: Ensure that you log and monitor every aspect of your VM or sandbox environment while the malware runs. This includes filesystem changes, network traffic, system API calls, memory dumps, and CPU activity.
- Frequent Snapshots: Take multiple snapshots throughout your testing process, especially before executing major changes or tests.
- Do Not Connect to the Internet: Unless absolutely necessary, avoid connecting your malware testing environment to the internet to prevent accidental spread or unintended consequences.
