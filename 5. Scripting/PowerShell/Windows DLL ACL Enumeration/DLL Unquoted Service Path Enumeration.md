# Unquoted DLL Service Paths Detection Script
# - This script identifies unquoted DLL paths with spaces in service definitions on the system.
# - It saves two output files: one for all ACL information and one for filtered ACL entries matching specific access rights.
# Step1_OutputFilePath: Contains all unquoted DLL paths identified from the services.
# Step2_OutputFilePath: Contains filtered or all unquoted DLL paths (customizable filtering logic can be added).

# Usage:
# .\DLL_Unquoted_Service_Paths.ps1



# Initialize output file paths
$Step1_OutputFilePath = "E:\Step1_Unquoted_DLL_Service_Paths.txt"
$Step2_OutputFilePath = "E:\Step2_Unquoted_DLL_Service_Paths_Filtered.txt"
