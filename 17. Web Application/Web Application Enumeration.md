# Summary
Web application enumeration is the process of identifying and gathering information about web applications and their components. This phase is crucial in penetration testing as it provides insights into the application's structure, functionalities, and potential vulnerabilities. The information gathered during enumeration can be used to plan and execute further attacks.

# Passive Enumeration
Passive enumeration involves collecting information about a web application without directly interacting with the target system. This method aims to minimize the risk of detection by using publicly available information and indirect techniques. Passive enumeration provides valuable insights into the web applicationâ€™s structure, technologies, and potential vulnerabilities, which can be used to plan further penetration testing activities.

## Types of Passive Enumeration
