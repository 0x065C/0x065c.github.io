# Summary
- **Service Name:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Category:** Cloud Computing Platform
- **Components:** Compute, Storage, Database, Networking, Analytics, Machine Learning, IoT, Security, and more.

## Google Cloud Platform Overview
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services provided by Google. It runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube. GCP offers a wide range of services including computing, data storage, data analytics, and machine learning.

GCP provides a mix of IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), and SaaS (Software as a Service) offerings. It enables businesses to build, test, and deploy applications on a highly scalable and reliable infrastructure.

## How GCP Works
GCP operates through a global network of data centers managed by Google. These data centers are organized into regions and zones. Each region is a separate geographic area, and each region has multiple zones. This structure provides high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability.

1. **Global Infrastructure:**
    - **Regions:** Geographic locations around the world where GCP clusters its data centers.
    - **Zones:** Multiple isolated locations within each region that provide redundancy and fault tolerance.
    
2. **Services and Resources:**
    - **Compute:** Services like Compute Engine, App Engine, and Kubernetes Engine offer flexible computing power.
    - **Storage:** Cloud Storage, Persistent Disks, and Filestore provide various storage solutions.
    - **Databases:** Managed database services like Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner, and Firestore.
    - **Networking:** Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Cloud Load Balancing, and Cloud CDN offer robust networking capabilities.
    - **Developer Tools:** Services like Cloud Build, Cloud Source Repositories, and Cloud Functions support the software development lifecycle.
    - **Security and Identity:** Identity and Access Management (IAM), Cloud Key Management, and Security Command Center provide security and identity management.

gcloud compute instance-groups managed create my-group --base-instance-name=my-instance --size=1 --template=my-template --zone=us-central1-a
gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling my-group --max-num-replicas=5 --min-num-replicas=1 --target-cpu-utilization=0.75 --zone=us-central1-a
```

2. **Storage:**
    - Store static assets (images, videos) in Google Cloud Storage.        
    - Use Persistent Disks for persistent block storage attached to Compute Engine instances.        
    - **Configuration:**        
        - Set up Cloud Storage bucket policies and Persistent Disk attachments.
        - **Example:** Attaching a persistent disk to an instance:

```
gcloud compute instances attach-disk my-instance --disk=my-disk --zone=us-central1-a
```

3. **Database:**
    - Use Google Cloud SQL for the relational database backend.        
    - Optionally, use Google Firestore for handling high-throughput, low-latency NoSQL database needs.        
    - **Configuration:**        
        - Configure Cloud SQL instances and Firestore databases.
        - **Example:** Setting up a Cloud SQL MySQL database:

```
gcloud sql instances create my-instance --database-version=MYSQL_8_0 --cpu=2 --memory=7680MB --zone=us-central1-a
```

4. **Networking:**
	- Set up a VPC to isolate the application’s network.    
	- Use HTTP(S) Load Balancing to distribute traffic across multiple Compute Engine instances.    
	- **Configuration:**    
	    - Configure VPC subnets, firewall rules, and load balancer settings.
	    - **Example:** Creating an HTTP(S) load balancer:

```
gcloud compute backend-services create my-backend-service --protocol=HTTP --port-name=http --health-checks=my-health-check --global

gcloud compute target-http-proxies create my-http-proxy --url-map=my-url-map
gcloud compute forwarding-rules create my-http-rule --global --target-http-proxy=my-http-proxy --ports=80
```

5. **Security:**
    - Use IAM to manage access control and permissions.        
    - Implement SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.        
    - Use Security Command Center to monitor and protect against security threats.        
    - **Configuration:**        
        - Configure IAM policies, SSL certificates, and Security Command Center settings.
        - **Example:** Creating an SSL certificate using Google-managed certificates:

```
gcloud compute ssl-certificates create my-ssl-cert --domains=example.com
```

6. **Monitoring and Logging:**
    - Use Google Cloud Monitoring to monitor application performance and resource utilization.        
    - Use Google Cloud Logging to log and audit API calls.        
    - **Configuration:**        
        - Set up Monitoring dashboards, alerts, and Logging sinks.
        - **Example:** Creating a monitoring alert policy:

```
gcloud monitoring policies create --policy-from-file=policy.json
```

# Additional Information

## Configuration Files

IAM Policy Example

```
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "role": "roles/viewer",
      "members": [
        "user:example-user@gmail.com"
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "roles/editor",
      "members": [
        "serviceAccount:my-service-account@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Firewall Rule Example

```
{
  "description": "Allow SSH and HTTP access",
  "name": "allow-ssh-http",
  "network": "global/networks/default",
  "sourceRanges": [
    "0.0.0.0/0"
  ],
  "allowed": [
    {
      "IPProtocol": "tcp",
      "ports": [
        "22",
        "80"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Potential Misconfigurations

- **Open Cloud Storage Buckets:** Publicly accessible Cloud Storage buckets can lead to data leakage.
- **Overly Permissive IAM Policies:** Using wildcards (*) in IAM policies can grant excessive permissions.
- **Firewall Rules with Open Ports:** Allowing inbound traffic from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0) can expose resources to attacks.
- **Unrestricted Cloud Functions:** Granting broad permissions to Cloud Functions can lead to privilege escalation.
- **Unencrypted Data:** Failing to encrypt data at rest and in transit can expose sensitive information.

## Default Credentials

- **GCP accounts should never use default credentials:** Always create individual IAM users with specific permissions.
- **Rotate Access Keys:** Regularly rotate access keys to minimize the risk of credential leakage.
- **Use Service Accounts:** Assign service accounts to services instead of using long-term access keys.

## IAM

- **Credential Leakage:** Exploiting leaked credentials to gain unauthorized access to GCP resources.
- **Role Assumption:** Assuming IAM roles with excessive permissions to escalate privileges.
- **IAM Role Privilege Escalation**
	- **Exploit:** Exploiting weak IAM role policies to escalate privileges.
	- **Mitigation:** Regularly review and tighten IAM policies, ensuring the principle of least privilege.

```
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "role": "roles/viewer",
      "members": [
        "user:example-user@gmail.com"

## Serverless (Cloud Functions)

- **Code Injection:** Injecting malicious code into Cloud Functions to execute unauthorized actions.
- **Event Injection:** Triggering Cloud Functions with crafted events to exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Cloud Function Misuse**
	- **Exploit:** Exploiting overly permissive Cloud Function execution roles to perform unauthorized actions.
	- **Mitigation:** Assign minimal permissions required for Cloud Functions and use IAM conditions to restrict actions.

```
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "role": "roles/cloudfunctions.invoker",
      "members": [
        "user:example-user@gmail.com"
